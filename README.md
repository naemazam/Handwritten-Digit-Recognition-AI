Handwritten Digit Recognition In Python


The Handwritten Digit Recognition In Python was developed using Python Deep Learning, This we are going to implement a handwritten digit recognition app using the MNIST dataset. We will be using a special type of deep neural network that is Convolutional Neural Networks. In the end, we are going to build a GUI in which you can draw the digit and recognize it straight away.

A Handwritten Digit Recognition s the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits. It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with many different flavors. The handwritten digit recognition is the solution to this problem which uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image.
