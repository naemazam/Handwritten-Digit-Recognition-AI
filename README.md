Handwritten Digit Recognition In Python


The Handwritten Digit Recognition In Python was developed using Python Deep Learning, This we are going to implement a handwritten digit recognition app using the MNIST dataset. We will be using a special type of deep neural network that is Convolutional Neural Networks. In the end, we are going to build a GUI in which you can draw the digit and recognize it straight away.
